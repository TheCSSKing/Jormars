description: A list of my favorite developer blogs
---

I love looking at other developers blogs, and not just when I'm skimming for an answer to a hard tech problem.  I get invaluable career advice and inspiration from reading what others are doing.  Most devs tend to build it themselves, which results in interesting design - for better or worse.

I've divided the list into two groups.  The first group are my personal favorites, due both to their content and interest areas.  The second group
are developers with great blogs, but ones that don't line up with my interests as faithfully (IE hardware, or systems programming).

# Other Good Ones

Great blogs, but not as closely aligned to my interests.

* [Adam Fuhrer](https://adamfuhrer.com/)
* [Jessie Frazelle](https://blog.jessfraz.com/)
* [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/) - A very cool site, but the dynamic UI really hinders usability.
