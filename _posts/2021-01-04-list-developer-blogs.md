description: A big list of developer blogs, hand selected for good design and quality content
---

Ever since deciding to put serious effort into my own website I've become fascinated with other developer blogs.  It started as a search for design ideas, but gradually turned into a more holistic process that had me reading heavily and learning more than I ever expected.

<!-- I found other developers to be an invaluable source of not only technical and career advice, but also inspiration.  It's something I'm trying to duplicate for others on my own site. -->

When I started out, there was no great list or directory of developer blogs. Each site seemed to live on its own island in a vast ocean, only surfacing briefly on Hackernews or Reddit.  I decided it would be helpful to both myself and others if there was a big authoritative list, so I put one together. I've since realized lots of developers have their own lists (see below), so  I now think of this as my personal map for an uncharted sea.

The criteria for this list is subjective, and boils down to a combination of having interesting content, good design, or both.  If you think your site should be listed, let me know.  I can't promise to add it, but I'll take a look (and give you feedback if you want).
